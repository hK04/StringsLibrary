# StringsLibrary
Library consisted of puts, strlen, strcpy, strncpy and others
```
\include\ - foldes with strings library, and headers consisted of __assert__ macro and print defines
\src\ - dynamic unit-test system. Not completed due to lack of knowlegde about strict types of functions. Maybe someday i'll fix it
```
